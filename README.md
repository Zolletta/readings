# Zolletta's Readings


I like reading a lot and sometimes I read technical books which I found very very interesting. 

Since one of the best tools for me is the elaboration / summarization of comcepts found in the materials I study, I decided to write some articles.

My purpose was not to write a full comprehensive summary of the book, but to squeeze out the most interesting part (for me): If I want to come back to a particular thing I can still re-read it :)

By trying to find out the main address (alas: there may be more than one!) of those books I wanted to to pursue two goals:

- find the books' essence
- transmit my love for those books to other 

The books you'll find here are chose by personal taste only and are related to technology at large: you won't find an article regarding a programming language book or kubernates or AWS for example. Those kind of books ages too fast.

I would say I am looking for books that would be worth to have on paper rather than in digital edition ;)


Some articles are not new: they were previoulsy published in Medium / Dev.to / and my last company's tecnical blog.

Versions you'll find here are the most updated.
